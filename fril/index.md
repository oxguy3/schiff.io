Fril (or FRIL) is a logic programming language invented in 1980 by professors [Trevor Martin](http://www.bristol.ac.uk/engineering/people/trevor-p-martin/) and Jim Baldwin at the University of Bristol. My A.I. professor is using this as the primary language for all assignments and lectures in the course, but it seems the language has just about dropped off the face of the earth. I'm trying to compile some useful information about the language in one convenient place.

## Installation
As best as I can tell, the last version of Fril to be published is Fril 4.984, from 23 August 2011. I only have these for Mac OS X and Windows, however. DOWNLOAD LINK TO GO HERE.

For older versions of Fril (which include versions that support Linux and Mac OS X on old PowerPC processors), see [this archived download page](https://web.archive.org/web/20120722103213/http://www.enm.bris.ac.uk/ai/martin/downloads/FrilResources.html)

### Syntax highlighting
Most text editors don't come with built-in syntax highlighting for Fril, so you will have to install it if you want it. Here are some links for various text editors:

* [Notepad++](https://gist.github.com/scholtes/dd2680ce9dd10907e32a02f6d8b94cb2)
* [Sublime Text](https://gist.github.com/scholtes/81c53fded4e32c22e016189acd22df34)

## Learning Fril
Fril is a logic programming language influenced by micro-PROLOG, which itself was influenced by the well-known Prolog language. The [Wikipedia article for Fril](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fril) does a decent job of covering the basics and comparing Fril to Prolog.

More online resources:
* [Fril Lecture Notes](http://www.ece.uc.edu/~aralescu/323Fall2005/LECTURES/Fril_index.html) (from Prof. Anca Ralescu's CS 323 class, Fall 2005, University of Cincinnati)
  * A walkthrough for the language.
* [Fril Online Reference Manual](manual/) (archived here, originally hosted on Trevor Martin's website)
  * Reference documentation for all of Fril's built-in predicates.

There's also a book called *Fril: Fuzzy and Evidential Reasoning in Artificial Intelligence (Uncertainty Theory in Artificial Intelligence, No 1)* by the creators that was published in 1995 that you can find in used condition on [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Fril-Evidential-Artificial-Intelligence-Uncertainty/dp/047195523X) or wherever.
